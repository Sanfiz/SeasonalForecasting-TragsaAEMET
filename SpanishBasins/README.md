### 1. Data

The followind datasets are used in this project:

1.1 **Climate Data Store (CDS)**: Provided by the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts).  It includes seasonal forecasting and hindcast models.  [Copernicus CDS website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).

1.2 **Spanish River Basin Districts**: Provided by The Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO). [MITECO website](https://www.miteco.gob.es/en/cartografia-y-sig/ide/descargas/agua/demarcaciones-hidrograficas-phc-2015-2021.html).


### 2. Scripts
- BoxPlot_HindcastForecast.py: processes forecast and hindcast data to calculate and visualise precipitation anomalies for Spanish basins during the extended winter.
- boxplot_NDJFM.py
- subplot_basins.py

### 3. 
Some of this scripts are based on ECMWF Jupyter Notebook: https://ecmwf-projects.github.io/copernicus-training-c3s/sf-verification.html and the author mSenande https://github.com/mSenande/SEAS-Forecast
