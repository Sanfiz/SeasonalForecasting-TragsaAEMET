### 1. Datasets

The following datasets are employed in this project:

1.1 **Climate Data Store (CDS)**: Provided by the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts), including seasonal forecasting and hindcast models. Available here: [Copernicus CDS website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).

1.2 **Spanish River Basin Districts**: Provided by the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO). Visit the [MITECO website](https://www.miteco.gob.es/en/cartografia-y-sig/ide/descargas/agua/demarcaciones-hidrograficas-phc-2015-2021.html) to download the data.

### 2. Scripts

- **BoxPlot_HindcastForecast.py**: Processes forecast and hindcast data to calculate and visualise precipitation anomalies for Spanish basins during the extended winter season.
- **boxplot_NDJFM.py**: Generates boxplots specific to Spanish basins' November to March (NDJFM) season.
- **subplot_basins.py**: Creates subplots to visualise various Spanish river basins.
